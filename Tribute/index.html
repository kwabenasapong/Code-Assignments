        <h3>Important Facts about Albert Einstein's life</h3>
        <ul>

                    <li>Ph.D. from Zurich University, Switzerland <strong>(1905)</strong></li>
                </ul>
                
            </li>
            <li>Albert Einstein grew up in Munich, where his father founded an electrical engineering company. </li>
            <li>After studying at the ETH University in Zurich, Einstein worked at the patent office in Bern, during 
                which time he produced several pioneering works in the field of physics. </li>
            <li>He was later employed at universities in Bern, Zurich, and Prague, and from 1914, in Berlin.</li>
            <li>After the Nazis seized power in Germany, Einstein immigrated to the US, where he worked at 
                the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton, New Jersey. He became a United States citizen 
                in 1940 and retired from his post in 1945.</li>
            <li>After World War II, Einstein was a leading figure in the World Government Movement, he 
                was offered the Presidency of the State of Israel, which he declined, and he collaborated 
                with Dr. Chaim Weizmann in establishing the Hebrew University of Jerusalem. </li>
            <li>On this day, <strong>November 9 in 1921</strong>, German-born theoretical physicist Albert Einstein was named
                 the winner of the Nobel Prize for Physics for his explanation of the photoelectric effect.</li>
            <li>Einstein’s researches are, of course, well chronicled and his more important works include 
                Special Theory of Relativity (1905), Relativity (English translations, 1920 and 1950), 
                General Theory of Relativity (1916), Investigations on Theory of Brownian Movement (1926), 
                and The Evolution of Physics (1938). Among his non-scientific works, About Zionism (1930), 
                Why War? (1933), My Philosophy (1934), and Out of My Later Years (1950) are perhaps the most important.</li>
            <li>Albert Einstein received honorary doctorate degrees in science, medicine and philosophy 
                from many European and American universities. During the 1920’s he lectured in Europe, 
                America and the Far East, and he was awarded Fellowships or Memberships of all the 
                leading scientific academies throughout the world. He gained numerous awards in 
                recognition of his work, including the Copley Medal of the Royal Society of London 
                in 1925, and the Franklin Medal of the Franklin Institute in 1935.</li>
            <li>Einstein married twice and had three children by his first marriage. He was 
                married to Mileva Marić between 1903 and 1919. They had three children, Lieserl (born 1902), 
                Hans Albert (born 1904) and Eduard (born 1910). He married Elsa Löwenthal in 1919 and they
